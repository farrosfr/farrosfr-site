In this article, I want to write a story about my experience working in a renewable energy company as an IT engineer in my country, Indonesia. Especially, I work in Yogyakarta, a city that attracts many tourists from various countries because it is near the Borobudur Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

I work at PT Tripower Solar Nusantara, with the website [https://solar-nusantara.id](https://solar-nusantara.id), which has an e-commerce platform called SonusHUB, available at [https://sonushub.id](https://sonushub.id). My main task is to handle both websites, as Solar Nusantara focuses on projects, while SonusHUB is for the sale of electrical materials, particularly in renewable energy, with a few items related to smart manufacturing materials. SonusHUB is a B2B and B2G platform, so the target clients are electricity shops, industries, government, and institutions.

Some things I want to share are the values I’ve gained from working at this company. Although it’s a small company, it is growing rapidly. Almost every day, we have meetings filled with a spirit to improve, even though we face many obstacles. We understand that surviving in the renewable energy field is not easy, especially when the government doesn’t provide enough subsidies and we must compete with conventional energy sources like coal and oil, which are still abundant and widely used.

It has forced me to grow as well, because renewable energy is something I believe in and consider a blessing. We utilize green energy, which is unlimited, like solar panels. We know that solar panels are still a great option, but there are some issues, such as inverter problems, hot spots, PID, weather damage, and dirt accumulation. These issues highlight the need for regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance.

I think that’s enough for this story; maybe I will continue it later. Thank you for reading, and I’m very open to discussion about renewable energy. For more details or to contact me, you can reach me via my company email: farros.alfatih@solar-nusantara.id.
