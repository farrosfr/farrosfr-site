Here, I want to share my daily solution for managing stress and other negative thoughts, such as sadness, boredom, and more. Furthermore, it can help build your muscles and self-discipline for free.

**Note:** Before you read further, I want to explain that I am not an expert in psychology, health, or related fields. This is just my personal solution, so it may be very relative to each person. Even though I believe this works, I could be wrong.

Actually, this method is somewhat inspired by various online communities focused on controlling lust and self-discipline. I’ve come across discussions where individuals suggest that when certain urges arise, one can counter them by engaging in a brief physical activity, such as doing 25 push-ups. Initially, I found this approach a bit awkward, especially considering how it might feel to do push-ups in a public setting. However, I now understand the underlying principle. Let me explain this further.

## Transforming Thoughts into Action

Rather than falling deeper into overthinking my negative thoughts, it’s better for me to search for a solution, even if it may be just temporary. I feel better when I try to do 10 push-ups at a time. If I don’t feel enough, I do 10 more push-ups, and so on. I might stop when I feel tired, but I often feel better than before.

## The Science Behind It

Some of the studies I have [read](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurobiological_effects_of_physical_exercise?utm_source=chatgpt.com) suggest that exercise is beneficial because it often releases endorphins, the ‘feel-good’ hormones that improve mood and reduce feelings of stress.

## How I Implement It and the Data

I have implemented this method into my daily routine, and I also track it in my mobile app, Loop Habit Tracker. You can download it for free from the Play Store or App Store. Sorry, I’m not endorsing it. Here is the chart that I try to record every day.

Push Ups / Dips in Loop Habbit Tracker

Sometimes i really don’t realize it. For example, if I am feel sad then I will do 10 push ups. But, in the end of the day i was actually surprised because of what! i do 350 push ups which is maybe ini this day i feel sad 35x (because of 10x35=350). Maybe this is the part of complexity, yes sadness is still complex i think.
