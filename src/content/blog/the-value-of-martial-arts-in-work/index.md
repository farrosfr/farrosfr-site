I have studied several martial arts disciplines. Starting from Karate, Pagar Nusa, Wushu, to Boxing (self-taught). There are many values emphasized there, one of which is the teaching of being a humble person.

Study real combat to avoid fighting as much as possible. Except in urgent matters or to protect other people, whether yourself, family, friends or even society. The more you practice hitting, the more afraid you will become of hitting.

There are many self-defense values that are applied at work, starting from honesty, courage and a sense of responsibility. Work hard until you are able to work smart by combining the two. Without fear, fight injustice loudly and do not underestimate any job as long as it is obtained in the right way (halal).

The purpose of being a strong person is to protect the weak. Instead of taking material from illegal methods, be it fraud, corruption, usury, and various other forms of crime. This includes helping people who do this, because it falls into the category of helping bad things.
